# 🧠 ebr-online-measurement

**ebr-online-measurement** (Eye Blink Rate Online Measurement) is a web-based platform designed to measure eye blink rate (EBR) in real time.  
It includes two experimental tasks — one **visual** and one **auditory** — enabling comparison of blink rates under different sensory conditions.

## 🎯 Overview

This project provides an accessible, browser-based tool to record and analyze eye blink rate (EBR) during cognitive or perceptual tasks.  
Both tasks use the same blink detection algorithm but differ in the type of presented stimuli:

- 👁️ **Visual Task** — participants are presented with **visual stimuli** while EBR is measured.  
- 🎧 **Auditory Task** — participants are presented with **auditory stimuli** while EBR is measured.
